        <div class="description">Some petty-minded people ruin their own opportunities by viewing their potential partners as being as mercantilistic as themselves. This is the way in which some trade war warriors in the United States see their country's trade relations with China.

        They see China, by selling more to the US, as being cunning or pursuing the strategic goal of eventually undoing the US. They say the US, which sells less merchandise to China, is being robbed of its jobs, and claim its economy is being raped.

        They refuse to see that every year China is buying a lot more services from the US, Chinese parents pay huge amounts to educate their children in US colleges, and that in more recent years, Chinese companies have begun investing more and more in US companies.

        In 2016, according to law firm Baker & McKenzie and research company Rhodium, China's direct investment into the US and Europe more than doubled, to a record $94.2 billion, even after almost $75 billion worth of deals were canceled for reasons that included US government objections.

        They also point out that in 2015, when China's total outbound investments hit a record high of $145 billion and the country overtook Japan to be the world's second-biggest cross-border investor after the US, China's investment was $15 billion in the US and $23 billion in Europe.
